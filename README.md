# i made this when i was horrible at coding


# Roblox Autobuy

This is a discord bot, that uses the roblox inventory API to check if a user has bought a clothing item, if successful, it will grant the discord user a role! It has options to set a temp role, and it offers a anti-bypassable purchase system!

# Main Features
- Automated purchase system
- Anti-bypassable
- .txt logs (purchase ids, and role times)
- Channel logs
- Mutliple item support
- Temporally role support (w/ restart support)
# More Information

This logs every single purchase ID done by a user, to ensure the same purchase cannot be used again! If you have a duration set, it will check saved_times every 15 mins to ensure it will remove the role on time, even after a restart!  The log channel logs every message sent to the bot, attempted bypasses, successful purchases, and if the user never responded.

This was orginally made for my server - Visionary - I have been using the same code since, and only have had 1-2 problems within 3 months
